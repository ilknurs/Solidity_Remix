// Question 1:
// Why are blockchain based tokens so revolutionary?

// Because people can now make investments anonymously.
// Because they represent ownership in digital assets that can be owned and transferred.
// Because you can use tokens to make transactions without having to pay taxes.


// Question 2:
// Why did the community create token standards?

// So that the community can control and approve the tokens that are created.
// In order to restrict the functionality of tokens to safe and non-malicious actions.
// So that the community can create tokens that are interoperable with other contracts, products, and services.


// Question 3:
// If you would create a decentralised application for a baseball trading card game where each baseball player would be represented by a token, what token standard would you use to write the token contract?

// ERC20
// ERC721
